Tornado hello world vs. CherryPy Hello world.  I used a raspberry pi computer as a test platform.

The ttest.py script and the cptest.py script reside on the pi and run in two command windows.

I ran the hellotest.py on my laptop to interrogate the two web scripts.
It basically throws 100 requests at each and sees how fast they respond.

Results:
Elapsed time tornado 3.22899985313
Elapsed time tornado 21.2269999981
